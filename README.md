# 🇪🇺 EuroStudent Deals

**EuroStudent Deals** is a comprehensive single-page application (SPA) designed to help students studying in Europe find high-value discounts. Unlike standard coupon sites, this platform focuses on "structural" benefits—such as national rail cards, museum passes, and essential tech infrastructure—organized by country and category.
